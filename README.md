# Channel Typing

> Based on this idea: https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/bex98j

Powercord plugin that shows a typing indicator next to channels where people are typing, even if you're not looking at
the channel. Also shows if there's someone typing in group DMs and who, even if you don't have it focused.
